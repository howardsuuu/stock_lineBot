This is an application that allows users to enter stock tickers, the script will calculate the moving average of each ticker and analyze using the MA theory. If the MA fulfills the requirment then it will push the message via LINE NOTIFY to the target users. I'm currently using Heroku for deploying. 


The feature we're working on: 1. Notify the user if the current stocks (the tickers you enter) have go up or down for certain percentage. 2. Enable LINE to read users' input and return the corresponded results (ex: User enter 'AAPL stock price', 'TSLA 5ma')
